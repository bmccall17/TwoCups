# TwoCups
a cooperative relationship game about acknowledgment.

helps two people notice, name, and transform everyday efforts into shared meaning.
not a productivity app, a habit tracker, or a scorekeeping system.
is a slow, intentional game designed to make care visible.

## what TwoCups is
TwoCups is a **cooperative meaning-making game** where:
- Effort is offered freely
- Acknowledgment completes the loop
- Shared presence is the reward

players track *attempts* to fill each other’s cups.
only the receiver can acknowledge an attempt.
when acknowledgment happens, intention transforms into experience.

---

## core metaphor
TwoCups uses a physical metaphor system:
- **Gems** → crystallized intention (“I tried”)
- **Liquid** → felt experience (“I received that”)
- **Coal** → time-compressed, unacknowledged effort (neutral, not punitive)
- **Cups** → individual capacity and shared relational space
the game visualizes how relationships are filled not by effort alone,
but by *being seen*.

## core loop
1. Player A logs an attempt to fill Player B’s cup  
2. A gem is created and remains unacknowledged  
3. Player B acknowledges the attempt  
4. The gem transforms into liquid  
5. Both the individual cup and the shared cup fill  
no acknowledgment → no transformation.

## design principles
- **Receiver completes the loop**  
  Acknowledgment cannot be automated or inferred.
- **No punishment mechanics**  
  Coal represents time, not failure.
- **Collective scorekeeping**  
  The goal is attunement, not optimization.
- **Slow by design**  
  TwoCups values rhythm, not streaks.
- **Relational > Individual**  
  The shared cup matters as much as personal cups.

---

## intended experience
players should feel:
- Safe offering effort
- Relieved when acknowledged
- Warmed by shared presence
- Curious about patterns over time
if a feature undermines these feelings, it does not belong.

---

## status
TwoCups is an evolving experiment in relational design.
the mechanics may grow, but the emotional truth must remain intact.

> *TwoCups is a mirror, not a measure.*
