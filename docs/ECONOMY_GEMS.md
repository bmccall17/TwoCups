# A *multi-gem economy* lets you encode meaning **and** reward depth of exchange—not just volume—while making the cups visually alive.

Below is a **clean, logical gem system** that maps intuitively to value, exchange type, and color payoff.

---

## Core Design Principle

* **Lower-value gems** = *initiative & effort (i.e. attempts & requests)*
* **Mid-value gems** = *mutual recognition & attunement*
* **High-value gems** = *shared meaning & commitment*

This keeps the system fair, expressive, and easier to spot trends visually.

## Gem Types & Values (Recommended)

| Gem          | Color             | Point Value     | Earned When                                           | Why It Makes Sense                                                   |
| ------------ | ----------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Emerald**  | Green             | **+1**          | Making an *attempt* to fill the other’s cup           | Growth, effort, life energy. Even imperfect attempts still matter.   |
| **Sapphire** | Blue              | **+2**          | Fulfilling a *specific request*                       | Clarity, trust, and listening. You didn’t guess—you heard.           |
| **Ruby**     | Red               | **+3**          | An *acknowledgment* (given to **both** players)       | Heart energy, passion, reciprocity. Recognition creates shared heat. |
| **Diamond**  | White / Prismatic | **+5 (or +10)** | Major milestones, overflow, or special mutual moments | Rarity, durability, shared meaning. These should feel special.       |

## Exchange Logic (How Gems Flow)

### 1. Attempt → Emerald

* Player A logs an attempt for Player B
* **Player A earns 1 Emerald** immediately

> “I showed up.”

### 2. Request Fulfilled → Sapphire (instead of Emerald)

* Attempt matches an active request
* **Player A earns 1 Sapphire (2 pts)**

> “I listened and delivered.”

*(You may optionally still give an Emerald + Sapphire for especially generous exchanges—but default to one gem to keep balance tight.)*

---

### 3. Acknowledgment → Rubies (Mutual)

When Player B acknowledges an attempt:

* **Player A earns 1 Ruby**
* **Player B earns 1 Ruby**
* **Collective Cup earns Ruby value**

> “We both saw and named what happened.”

This is the emotional core of the game.

---

### 4. Overflow / Ritual Moments → Diamonds

Diamonds should be **rare and ceremonial**, not grindable.

Good triggers:
* Cup overflow (hitting 100)
* Both players acknowledge the *same* day’s exchange
* Weekly “reflection close”
* Anniversary / ritual moment

Reward options:

* **1 Diamond to each**
* OR **1 Diamond to the collective cup only**
* OR **Diamond converts to a visual-only sparkle (no points)** if you want to keep scoring conservative

---

## Cup Filling Visual Logic (This Is Where It Shines ✨)

Instead of generic fill, cups become *mosaics*:

* **Emeralds** → soft green base layer (effort & momentum)
* **Sapphires** → blue accents (clarity & listening)
* **Rubies** → red highlights (recognition & warmth)
* **Diamonds** → prismatic flares, sparkles, glow effects

### Visual storytelling idea

> A cup full of emeralds = “We’re trying.”
> A cup with rubies = “We’re seeing each other.”
> Diamonds = “This mattered.”

---

## Anti-Gaming Safeguards (Built Into Gem Choice)

* Emeralds are low value → spamming doesn’t dominate
* Sapphires require *requests* → intentionality
* Rubies require *the other person* → mutual consent
* Diamonds are *system-awarded* → no exploitation

---

## Optional Advanced Layer (Later, Not MVP)

You could later:

* Allow **gem fusion** (e.g., 3 Emeralds → 1 Sapphire)
* Let couples **rebalance gem weights** in Settings
* Introduce *seasonal gem themes* (amethyst, gold, obsidian)

But this base set is already strong, legible, and emotionally coherent.

---

## TL;DR (If You Need the Tight Version)

* **Emerald (1)** = effort
* **Sapphire (2)** = listened & delivered
* **Ruby (3)** = mutual recognition
* **Diamond (5–10)** = shared meaning / milestone


---


# Now let's add **temporal truth** and **emotional honesty** to the economy without shaming or punishment. 
## Addendum: Gems as Catalysts, Liquid as Experience
### Core Distinction
In this economy, **gems represent events**, while **liquid represents lived experience**.
* **Gems are earned through action** (attempts, fulfillment, acknowledgment).
* **Liquid only exists through acknowledgment**.
* Until acknowledged, gems remain *potential*, not experience.

This preserves a crucial truth:

> *Effort alone does not equal feeling filled. Experience is completed through recognition.*

---

## State Model: From Action to Experience

Every logged interaction moves through **states**, not just point values.

### 1. Solid State — *Potential*

When a player:
* Makes an attempt
* Makes a request
* Fulfills a request
* Names an intention
They earn a **gem in solid form**.

Solid gems:
* Are visible in ledgers and timelines
* Represent *effort, intention, or care offered*
* **Do not yet fill the cup**

This is intentional.
The cup reflects *received and acknowledged experience*, not just effort.

---

### 2. Acknowledgment → Dissolution (Transformation Moment)

When the receiving player **acknowledges** an action:
* The corresponding gem **transforms**
* The gem **dissolves into liquid**
* Liquid flows into:
  * The receiver’s cup
  * The giver’s cup
  * The collective cup (where applicable)

This is the **primary alchemical moment** of the system.

> Acknowledgment is the catalyst that turns action into experience.

---

## Liquid Properties (Result of Dissolution)

When gems dissolve, they contribute:
* **Volume** (how full the cup becomes)
* **Color** (the emotional quality of the experience)
* **Motion** (freshness, vitality, resonance)

Each gem type influences the resulting liquid differently:
* Emerald → light, flowing nourishment
* Sapphire → steady, clarifying depth
* Ruby → warmth, glow, shared heat
* Diamond → prismatic shimmer, resonance beyond volume

---

## Unacknowledged Requests & Stagnation (Coal State)

Not all requests or attempts are acknowledged.
This is not a failure—it is **information**.

### Time-Based Transformation

If a request or attempt remains unacknowledged for an extended period:

* It **does not dissolve**
* It **slowly compresses**
* It transitions into a **Coal state**

Coal represents:

* Stagnant potential
* Unmet but still valid desire
* Energy that has not yet been metabolized

Coal is **neutral**, not negative.

> Coal is not bad love.
> It is love that has not found oxygen.

---

### Visual & Symbolic Treatment of Coal

* Dark, matte, grounded
* Settles at the bottom of the cup or ledger
* Adds **weight**, not fullness
* Signals “something here wants attention”

Coal:

* Does **not** reduce scores
* Does **not** drain liquid
* Simply marks *paused energy*

---

## Reignition: Coal Can Still Transform

Coal is **not permanent**.

If a previously stagnant request is later acknowledged:
* Coal **re-ignites**
* It transforms into liquid
* Often with **greater intensity or warmth**

This mirrors real life:
* Long-held needs, when finally seen, can be deeply impactful

Optionally:
* Coal-to-liquid transformations may carry a subtle visual emphasis (slow glow, ember flare, warmth ripple)

---

## Why This Matters (Design Intent)

This layer ensures the economy:
* Honors effort **without equating it to receipt**
* Makes acknowledgment emotionally central
* Allows stagnation to be *visible but not punitive*
* Reflects real relational dynamics over time

The system does not ask:
> “Who did more?”

It asks:
> “What was experienced, together?”

---

## Summary

* **Gems** = actions, intentions, moments
* **Acknowledgment** = catalyst
* **Liquid** = lived, received experience
* **Coal** = stagnant but valid potential
* **Transformation** = always possible

This economy is not about optimization.
It is about **making invisible relational truths gently visible**.

---

If you want, next we can:

* Define **exact time thresholds** for coal
* Decide whether coal appears in **personal vs shared cups**
* Name the liquid itself (which is a surprisingly powerful choice)
* Or write the **in-app microcopy** that teaches this without ever explaining it

This is already a very humane system.
