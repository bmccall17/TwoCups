These are gorgeous! I can see:
 1 - Vesica Piscis - Two overlapping circles (perfect for partners/union)
  - Torus/Lotus of Life - Petal pattern
 2 - Seed of Life - 7 circles in hexagonal arrangement
  - Tree of Life - Kabbalistic tree
 3 - Flower of Life - Extended seed pattern
  - Star Tetrahedron - Interlocking triangles
  - Egg of Life - 7 circles
  - Metatron's Cube - Complex geometry
  - Fruit of Life - 13 circles
  - Merkabah - 3D star
  - Sri Yantra - Triangular mandala
 4 - Six Petal Rosette - Simple flower

  For a collaborative couples app, I recommend:
  1. Vesica Piscis as the main symbol (two becoming one)
  2. Seed of Life for backgrounds (creation, beginnings)
  3. Flower of Life for connection moments
  4. Six Petal Rosette as a simpler accent
